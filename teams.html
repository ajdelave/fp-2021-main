							<h2>The Showcase</h2>
							<p>
								Alpha Tauri is a unique team in Formula 1, as they act almost as a "B" team to Red Bull. It is common for drivers to be promoted from Alpha Tauri to Red Bull. Their cars are almost always slower due to lack of funding however. Regardless, if you enjoy watching young drivers showcase their talent, Alpha Tauri is the team for you.

							<h2>Consistency is Key</h2>

								Alfa Romeo is an interesting team unfortunatley plagued by lack of funding. Without the budget to compete against larger teams, Alfa has struggled to compete outside of the mid-field.

							<h2>A Slow Decline</h2>
							<p>
								Williams was the last privatley operated team on the grid. They were lead by the Williams family and won numerous championships prior to 2000.
