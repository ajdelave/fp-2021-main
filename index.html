			<h1>Formula 1 Overview</h1>
				<p id='intro'> This website is a dedicated fan page to my favorite sport, Formula 1. As the motorsport is not widely popular in the United States, this page serves as an introduction to the core aspect of the competition. Information on the teams, circuits, and drivers of F1 is available on the subsequent pages. If you have any further questions about the sport, feel free to reach out using the contact form.</p>
			<h2 id = "why">Why Formula 1?</h2>
				<p>Before I explain the history and general rules of Formula 1, you might be wondering what makes the sport unique and why should I watch it? Simply put, the cars are fast. Unlike traditional sports involving athletes, coaches and teams; Formula 1 is all about the pairing of engineering and driver skill. Every year, teams spend on average 200 million dollars to develop just two cars. Hundreds of engineers explore new tricks to make the cars faster and push the limits of what is possible. If you enjoy watching these feats, paired with great on-track racing, F1 is the sport for you. </p>
			<h2 id = "history">History</h2>
				<p>Formula 1 first began racing in post-war Europe starting in 1950. The competition's name comes from the "formula" of rules to which comptetitors must comply. The first race was held at Silverstone in the United Kingdom, with additional races taking place across Europe. Racing was orginally very dangerous, as 13 drivers were killed in just the first decade of the sport's existence. Despite setbacks, Formula 1 grew in both popularity and scope. As the years have passed, additional competitors and constructors (teams) have joined Formula 1, further enhancing the performance and saftey of the cars.    </p>
			<h2 id = "guidelines">Competition Guidelines</h2>
				<p>Formula 1 currentls consists of ten teams from all around the world. Every team, or constrcutor, is responsible for manufacturing and outfitting two identical cars. Each team subsequently has two drivers who race in 20+ competitions hosted across a variety of circuits. Points are allocated based on the best finisher in each competition. </p>
			<h2 id = "championships">Championships</h2>
				<p>Unlike most sports in the world, Formula 1 has two annual championships. One is for the drivers and the other is for the constructors. As driver perfomance doesn't always correlate with car perfomance, it's important to recognize the individual accolades belonging either to the driver or the team who built the car. The generalized perfomance of each team and driver in the other pages on this site.</p>
